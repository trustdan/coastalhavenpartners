**Tagline:** *Where Elite Talent Meets Boutique Opportunity*

## The Problem We Solve

### For Candidates
- **Black hole applications**: Submitting resumes into portals with zero feedback
- **No differentiation**: GPAs and credentials buried in stacks of identical PDFs
- **Access gap**: Non-target school students lack direct paths to boutique firms
- **Information asymmetry**: No visibility into which firms are actually hiring

### For Recruiters
- **Resume noise**: Hundreds of unverified applications to sift through
- **Verification burden**: Manually checking GPAs, enrollment status, graduation dates
- **Inefficient sourcing**: Campus visits and career fairs yield diminishing returns
- **Quality variance**: No way to pre-filter for serious, qualified candidates

## Recruiter Outreach Strategy

### Phase 1: Build the Contact Database

**Target Contacts:**
- Head of Campus Recruiting
- Campus Recruiting Manager
- University Relations Manager
- Analyst/Associate Program Manager
- Talent Partner (VC-specific)
- Chief of Staff (at smaller firms)

**Verified Sources Only:**
- Apollo.io / Lusha / ContactOut (90%+ confidence emails only)
- Hunter.io with verification
- LinkedIn Contact Info sections
- University career services recruiting guides
- Company career pages with direct contacts
- Conference speaker/attendee lists (TOIGO, SEO, MLT)

**Goal:** 150-200 verified recruiter contacts across 75+ firms

### Phase 2: Segmented Outreach

**Tier 1: Boutique Firms (Highest Priority)**
- Smaller recruiting teams = higher pain point
- More likely to adopt new tools quickly
- Personal outreach, emphasize efficiency gains

**Tier 2: Mid-Size Firms**
- Growing firms with scaling challenges
- Emphasize quality of candidate pool
- Offer pilot program with select candidates

**Tier 3: Large Firms**
- Longer sales cycles, more stakeholders
- Focus on specific divisions or programs
- Leverage social proof from Tier 1 wins

### Phase 3: Outreach Messaging

**Email Angle for Boutiques:**
> Subject: Verified finance candidates for [Firm Name]
>
> [Name], I'm building a curated network of GPA-verified candidates specifically for boutique PE/IB/VC recruiting.
>
> Unlike job boards, every candidate is school-confirmed with verified credentials. You can filter by GPA, school, major, and grad year in seconds.
>
> Would you be open to a 10-minute call to see if this fits your recruiting workflow?

**Email Angle for Large Firms:**
> Subject: Pilot opportunity - verified candidate pipeline
>
> [Name], Coastal Haven Partners is a new network of pre-vetted finance candidates (GPA-verified, school-confirmed).
>
> We're offering select firms early access to our candidate pool before public launch. Would [Firm] be interested in a pilot?

### Phase 4: Conversion Funnel

1. **Cold outreach** (email + LinkedIn)
2. **Discovery call** (10 min, understand their process)
3. **Demo access** (show them the candidate filtering)
4. **Pilot program** (free access to 20-50 candidates)
5. **Paid tier** (full access, premium features)

### Phase 5: Flywheel Effect

```

        ↓

        ↓
   Attracts more candidates
        ↓
